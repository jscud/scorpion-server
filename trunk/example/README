Before running the example server, you will need to generate an SSL 
certificate used for setting up an HTTPS connection. Here's a command 
which will prompt you for information for creating a new certificate:

openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem -days 365 -nodes

Running the above command will create a file named server.pem and this
file must be placed in the config directory.

After creating your server.pem file, you are ready to run the example
server. If you have not already installed the scorpion server modules,
run:

python setup.py install 

in the project's root directory. Then start the example server by running:

python run_example_server.py

Once the server is up and running, open your web browser and point it at

https://localhost/public

To test authentication, try accessing the following resource, which is 
protected by a username and password ("user" and "password").

https://localhost/user
