This server functions as a remote data store. All traffic is sent over SSL (TLS) and users authenticate using Basic auth. The design emphasizes simplicity over all else. Users who can write in a directory are able to POST new data therby creating new files on the web server.

This is a work in progress and the design is still evolving.
